Console-based Google Play Music player written in Rust.

## Status

I'm currently researching the unofficial documentation to the Google Play Music api.

## About

This project is inspired by the [Pianobar](https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar) project which provides access to listening to Pandora radio from the commandline.
When I was in middle school, I always carried a copy of `Pianobar.exe` around with me on my flash drive so I could listen to Pandora music on the school computers which blocked `pandora.com` traffic.

When I'd come home after school, I'd play a game on my home computer, but back then I didn't have enough ram or processing power to run a full web browser and the game, so I'd once again use Pianobar to get the tunes rocking at a solid 5-7mb of RAM usage.

I have very fond memories of music from that time in my life, and much of the music I discovered and learned about was a result of the Pianobar project.

I guess Google Play Music isn't the hippest music streaming service around, but I have found its radio station algorithms to strike an admirable balance between discovering music and keeping the tracks similar.

This is mostly for fun, and the mvp intends to focus on simplicy and usability.

I'd like to be able to execute `playbar` and have some music play, for now.
Perhaps a way to mix two stations together would be fun as well.
We'll see...
